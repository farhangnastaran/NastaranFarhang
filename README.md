# Nastaran Farhang (Short Bio & CV)

 👋 Hi, I'm Nastaran Farhang

I'm a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Sydney with a PhD in Astronomy/Solar Physics. My research focuses on complex systems, plasma physics, and the statistical analysis and modeling of solar phenomena. I apply statistical, signal processing, and network-based methods to study solar flares, coronal loop dynamics, and magnetic field structures—contributing to both flare detection and space weather forecasting.
